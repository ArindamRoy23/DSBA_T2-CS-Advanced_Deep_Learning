    "Generative modelling in machine learning can aim at achieving different goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first, obvious one is that a generative model can be used to generate more data, to be used afterwards by another algorithm. While a generative model cannot create more information to solve the issue of having too small datasets, it could be used to solve anonymity questions. Typically, sharing a generative model trained on private data could allow the exploitation of the statistical property of this data without sharing the data itself (which can be protected by privacy matters for example).\n",
    "\n",
    "Another goal is to use generative modelling to better understand the data at hand. This is based on the hypothesis that a model that successfully learned to generate (and generalize) a dataset should have internally learned some efficient and compressed representation of the information contained in the data. In this case, analysing a posteriori the learned representation may give us insights on the data itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "The notion of a generative model however needs to be more formally specified, in order to work with. What does it mean for the model to generate data that \"looks like\" the original dataset? A mathematical formulation of that is necessary, in order to define a training objective that can be used efficiently. Having some expert rate the quality of all generated datapoints one by one is definitely not an option.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, modelling our data and models as probability distributions comes to the rescue. If we consider our data as coming from some underlying probability distribution, that we will name $p_D$, our goal is thus to train our model to represent another probability distribution, which we will name $p_\\theta$, that should be some good approximation of $p_D$. Given that we only know $p_D$ through some set of realisations from it (the dataset), we can never hope to learn it exactly."

    "Another approach to generative modelling is given by Normalizing flows. The idea is to learn a mapping $f$ from the data distribution $p_D$ (defined over a space $\\mathcal{X}$) to a known distribution (typically, a normal distribution) from which we know how to sample. Two key points are to be noted:\n",
    "1. The mapping needs to be bijective (i.e., the network needs to be invertible).\n",
    "2. The exact likelihood of a data point should be easily computable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To tackle point 2, let us introduce some notations.\n",
    "Let us denote by $p_\\mathcal{N} = \\mathcal{N}(0,1)$ the normal distribution from which we sample $z$. We obtain points $x$ by computing $x = f^{-1}(z)$, and we hope that the distribution of points obtained this way will match more or less the dataset distribution $p_D$ of real examples.\n",
    "We denote by $p_G$ this obtained distribution, that is, the image of $p_\\mathcal{N}$ through $f^{-1}$: $p_G$ is a probability distribution defined on $\\mathcal{X}$, and our goal will be to optimize the mapping $f$ so that $p_G$ is close to $p_D$. If you are not familiar with images of distributions, the definition is here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pushforward_measure ; it can be defined as the measure that satisfies this change of variables: $\\int_{z\\sim p_\\mathcal{N}} g(f^{-1}(z)) dz = \\int_{x\\sim p_{G}} g(x) dx$ for all functions $g$. Another notation for this is $\\int_{z} g(f^{-1}(z)) \\;dp_\\mathcal{N}(z) = \\int_{x} g(x) \\;dp_{G}(x)$. \n",

It involves two Markov chains, one that forwards data to noise, and another that reverses this process by converting the noise back to data. The forward chain is usually designed to transform any data distribution into a simpler prior distribution, such as a standard Gaussian distribution, while the reverse Markov chain is parametrized by a neural network and learns to reverse this process. To generate new data points, we first sample a random vector from the prior distribution, then applies ancestral sampling through the reverse Markov chain.\n"
